## Bio

I am a geographer, engaged in geospatial analysis and location
intelligence projects at [NielsenIQ](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/).
In the field of geographic information science and socio-spatial
demographics, my research extends over several domains such as consumer
and market analysis, retail, real estate, transport and environment risk
and conservation.

Over the past few years, I have studied the spatial organizations of
stores and the consumption of fast-moving consumer goods, specially on
supermarket and hypermarket channels.

I hold a master’ s degree in geosciences (governance of risk and
resources) from University of Heidelberg and geospatial sciences
(geographic information science and computing) from University College
London.

You can find my detailed CV [here](cv.qmd).
